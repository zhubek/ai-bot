# ChatKit Integration Status

## Summary

I've successfully integrated OpenAI ChatKit infrastructure into your application to connect to your Agent Builder workflow. However, the ChatKit component is not rendering yet, which requires further investigation.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Package Installation ✅
- Installed `@openai/chatkit-react` package
- Package is available and correctly installed in node_modules

### 2. Environment Configuration ✅
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID` to `.env`:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID="wf_6900754807448190befbb45a1026d8810a57ce1a8b9220a1"
  ```
- Your workflow URL: https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder/edit?workflow=wf_6900754807448190befbb45a1026d8810a57ce1a8b9220a1

### 3. Session API Endpoint ✅
- Created `/src/app/api/chatkit/session/route.ts`
- Endpoint exchanges OpenAI API key for client tokens
- Calls OpenAI's realtime sessions API with your workflow_id
- Returns `client_secret` for frontend use

### 4. ChatKit Component ✅
- Created `/src/components/ChatKitInterface.tsx`
- Implements `useChatKit` hook with session management
- Renders `<ChatKit>` component with custom header
- Integrated with your existing UI (back button, assistant icons)

### 5. Frontend Integration ✅
- Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to use `ChatKitInterface` instead of `ChatInterface`
- Component loads without errors
- Header displays correctly with "Powered by OpenAI Agent Builder"

## Current Issue

The ChatKit component area is rendering empty (blank). The session API endpoint hasn't been called yet, which suggests:

1. The ChatKit component may not be initializing properly
2. The `@openai/chatkit-react` package might be incomplete or have different usage patterns
3. Additional configuration or different import approach may be needed

## Next Steps to Debug

### Option 1: Check ChatKit Component Rendering
1. Add console.log statements to `ChatKitInterface.tsx` to verify the component is mounting
2. Check if `useChatKit` hook is being called
3. Verify if there are any React errors in the browser console

### Option 2: Verify Package Documentation
The `@openai/chatkit-react` package may have different usage than documented. You should:
1. Check if there's an updated official example from OpenAI
2. Look at the actual package exports: `node_modules/@openai/chatkit-react/dist/index.d.ts`
3. Verify if the component needs additional props or configuration

### Option 3: Alternative Approach - Use Vanilla ChatKit
If the React package doesn't work, you could:
1. Install `@openai/chatkit` (vanilla JS version)
2. Use the web component directly: `<openai-chatkit>`
3. Initialize it manually in a useEffect hook

### Option 4: Use Direct API Integration
Instead of ChatKit components, implement direct integration:
1. Use the session endpoint you've created
2. Build custom UI with streaming responses
3. Make direct calls to OpenAI's realtime API

## Code References

### Session API Endpoint
Location: `src/app/api/chatkit/session/route.ts`

Creates sessions with OpenAI:
```typescript
fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/sessions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17",
    workflow_id: workflowId,
  }),
});
```

### ChatKit Component
Location: `src/components/ChatKitInterface.tsx`

Current implementation:
```typescript
const { control } = useChatKit({
  api: {
    async getClientSecret(existing) {
      if (existing) return existing;

      const response = await fetch("/api/chatkit/session", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });

      const { client_secret } = await response.json();
      return client_secret;
    },
  },
});

return <ChatKit control={control} className="h-full w-full" />;
```

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Check the ChatKit package documentation and examples
   - The package may be in beta and have limited/changing documentation
   - OpenAI's ChatKit is relatively new (announced October 2025)

2. **Fallback Plan**: If ChatKit doesn't work, use the existing implementation
   - Your original `ChatInterface.tsx` works fine
   - The OpenAI Agents SDK integration we built earlier is functional
   - You can modify it to add the workflow_id to agent configurations

3. **Contact OpenAI**: Since this is a new feature, you may need:
   - Official starter template from OpenAI
   - Direct support from OpenAI's team
   - Access to beta documentation

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/app/api/chatkit/session/route.ts` - Session creation endpoint
- `src/components/ChatKitInterface.tsx` - ChatKit React component
- `CHATKIT_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `.env` - Added NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Changed to use ChatKitInterface
- `package.json` - Added @openai/chatkit-react dependency

### Preserved Files (Still Functional)
- `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` - Original implementation (works with mock data)
- `src/lib/agents/*` - OpenAI Agents SDK integration (alternative approach)
- `src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts` - Streaming endpoint using Agents SDK

## Testing the Application

The application currently:
- ✅ Loads without errors
- ✅ Shows assistant selection screen
- ✅ Displays chat header when assistant is selected
- ❌ ChatKit component area is empty/not rendering

You can still test with the original implementation by changing `src/app/page.tsx` back to use `ChatInterface` instead of `ChatKitInterface`.
